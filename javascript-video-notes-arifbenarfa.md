- Beginning the Beginner's series (1 of 51):
  This video shows the outline and objective of the series, which shows a clear explanation of JavaScript. It made me know that the subjects could be put in different parts of the course and contribute to one another.
  
- What is JavaScript (2 of 51):
   I learned the nature of JavaScript, its purpose, and how it is used to make websites interactive. The introduction confirmed the reason why JavaScript is a language worth learning.
  
- Populating arrays (31 of 51):
  This video described the process of inserting values in Arrays and retrieving them with the help of indices. It made me understand the practical use of arrays in the storage and manipulation of data collections.
  
- Functions (37 of 51):
  I got to know the use of functions that help you reuse code in a particular block that is named. This was one of the significant ideas to maintain the order in the code and prevent repetitions.
  
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (41 of 51):
  The episode has been pointing out to the simplicity and structure of the data representation through JSON. I have found it particularly valuable since JSON is frequently applied to work with APIs and the exchange of data.
  
- Demo: JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) (42 of 510):
  The demo simplified the understanding of the concept of JavaScript objects considerably by demonstrating the way objects are constructed and brought into use in real-life scenarios. Watching it in practice allowed relating theory to practice.
  
- Package management (49 of 51):
  This video presented the concept of package management of external libraries through the use of package managers. I was interested in the extent to which development is based on common reusable code instead of in-house development.
